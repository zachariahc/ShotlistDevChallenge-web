## Overview

Working with an existing code base, you will be extending some basic functionality within a subset of the existing Shotlist application. The objective of which is to give your interviewer a glimpse into your experience with SwiftUI and to present you with a common code reorganization problem.

## How to work on this challenge

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/dyashy/ShotlistDevChallenge-web`
2. Modify the code locally
3. Create a pull request with your code when ready to submit

## Time

We have given you a set of tasks which should take no more than 10 hours to complete. Although working on this challenge for longer than 10 hours is fine, we will not expect you to do so. If you find yourself having worked the allotted time and have not completed all milestones, you may stop working and write out some notes on what you were tying to accomplish and what you would have liked to do next. We will not evaluate how much you accomplished, but rather would like to understand your thought process and what you spend that time working on.

## Current code

You will be given a ReactJS project generated with **create-react-app** using **Node 12.16.3**. This project's dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file and you may pull in external dependencies as you feel necessary. The project's `App.js` file calls a single `BrandOnboarding` React component which is the basis of this challenge. Your tasks will be to modify certain of this preview's sub-views in the alloted time.

## Milestones

We are giving you three primary tasks:
1. Create a progress bar for the top of the page as shown here:

2. Add a responsive breakpoint for mobile devices that hides the sidebar image on each page (shown below)

3. Create an append-only list for adding team emails on the final onboarding page:
